This repository consists of the code and report for the project titiled - *Determining early readmission of diabetes patients within 30 days of discharge.*

This project deals with building a model which determines if the discharged diabetic patient gets readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The data set used in this project is taken from [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). The link to the data set is attached [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). The data set consists of `101766` instances of hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes. To make predictions, some machine learning models were build and trained using the above linked data. Detailed comparision of which model worked best along with the related metrics is outlined in [this](https://github.com/LakshmiGayathri19/Applied-Data-Science-Project/blob/main/ADS_Final_Report.pdf) report. 

In order to access the models mentioned in the above attached report, go thorugh the `.ipynb` files present in this repository. 
* ADS-Final-Code.ipynb - This notebook file consists of all the models tried from starting to ending.
* ADS-Final-Code-Another-Approach.ipynb - This notebook file consists of experimenting with the final model by performing data augmentation and feature engineering.
